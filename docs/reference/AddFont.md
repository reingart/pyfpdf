## AddFont ##

```python
fpdf.add_font(family: str, style = '', fname = '', uni = False)
```

### Description ###

Imports a TrueType, OpenType or Type1 font and makes it available.

**Warning:** For !Type1 and legacy fonts it is necessary to generate a font 
definition file first with the `MakeFont` utility. This feature is currently 
deprecated in favour to TrueType unicode font support (whose are automatically 
processed with the `ttfonts.py` included utility).

**Note**: the font source files must be accessible. They are searched 
successively in (if this constants are defined):

  * `FPDF_FONTPATH` (by default, `font` folder in the fpdf package directory)
  * `SYSTEM_TTFONTS` (i.e. `C:\WINDOWS\FONTS`)

If the file corresponding to the requested font is not found, the runtime 
exception _"TTF Font file not found: "_ is raised.

For more information, see [Unicode](../Unicode.md) support page.

The method should be called before [SetFont](SetFont.md) method is used, and the
font will be available for the whole document.

**Note**: due font processing can occupy large amount of time some data are 
cached. Files created in same folder by default. For more information see
[SetCache](SetCache.md).

### Parameters ###

family:
> Family font. Used as a reference for [SetFont](SetFont.md), for example: `'dejavu'`

style:
> Font style. Deprecated, maintained only for backward compatibility.

fname:
> Font file name (i.e. `'DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf'`). You can specify a full 
path, if not, the file will be searched in `FPDF_FONTPATH` or `SYSTEM_TTFONTS`

uni:
> TTF Unicode flag (if set to `True`, TrueType font subset embedding will be 
enabled and text will be treated as `utf8` by default).

You must _not call_ AddFont for PDF Standard Latin-1 fonts (Courier, Helvetica, 
Times, Symbol, Zapfdingbats), use SetFont directly in that case.

Calling this method with uni=False is discouraged as legacy font support is 
complex and deprecated.


### Example ###

```python
# Add a Unicode free font
pdf.add_font('DejaVu', '', 'DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf', uni = True)

# Add a Unicode system font (using full path)
pdf.add_font('sysfont', '', r"c:\WINDOWS\Fonts\arial.ttf", uni = True)
```
