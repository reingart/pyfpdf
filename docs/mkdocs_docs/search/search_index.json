FAQ What is FPDF? What is this library not? How does this library compare to ...? What does the code look like? Does this library have any framework integration? What is the development status of this library? What is the license of this library (pyfpdf)? What is FPDF? FPDF (and PyFPDF) is a library with low-level primitives to easily generate PDF documents. This is similar to ReportLab's graphics canvas, but with some methods to output \"fluid\" cells (\"flowables\" that can span multiple rows, pages, tables, columns, etc). It has two methods (\"hooks\") that can be implemented in a subclass, headers and footers. Originally developed in PHP several years ago (as a free alternative to proprietary C libraries), it has been ported to many programming languages, including ASP, C++, Java, Pl/SQL, Ruby, Visual Basic, and of course, Python. For more information see: http://www.fpdf.org/en/links.php What is this library not ? This library is not a: charts or widgets library (but you can import PNG or JPG images, use PIL or any other library, or draw the figures yourself; see examples) \"flexible page layout engine\" like Reportlab PLATYPUS (but it can do columns, chapters, etc.; see the Tutorial ) XML or object definition language like Geraldo Reports , Jasper Reports, or similar (but look at write_html for simple HTML reports and Templates for fill-in-the-blank documents) PDF text extractor, converter, splitter or similar. Look at pyPdf . How does this library compare to ...? The API is geared toward giving the user access to features of the Portable Document Format as they are described in the Adobe PDF Reference Manual, this bypasses needless complexities for simpler use cases. It is small: Source folder < 200Kb. It includes cell and multi_cell primitives to draw fluid document like invoices, listings and reports, and includes basic support for HTML rendering. Compared to other solutions, this library should be easier to use and adapt for most common documents (no need to use a page layout engine, style sheets, templates, or stories...), with full control over the generated PDF document (including advanced features and extensions). What does the code look like? Following is an example similar to the Reportlab one in the book of web2py. Note the simplified import and usage: ( http://www.web2py.com/book/default/chapter/09?search=pdf#ReportLab-and-PDF ) PyFPDF: from fpdf import FPDF def get_me_a_pyfpdf(): title = \"This The Doc Title\" heading = \"First Paragraph\" text = 'bla ' * 10000 pdf = FPDF() pdf.add_page() pdf.set_font('Times', 'B', 15) pdf.cell(w=210, h=9, txt=title, border=0, ln=1, align='C', fill=0) pdf.set_font('Times', 'B', 15) pdf.cell(w=0, h=6, txt=heading, border=0, ln=1, align='L', fill=0) pdf.set_font('Times', '', 12) pdf.multi_cell(w=0, h=5, txt=text) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return pdf.output(dest='S') Reportlab: from reportlab.platypus import * from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet from reportlab.rl_config import defaultPageSize from reportlab.lib.units import inch, mm from reportlab.lib.enums import TA_LEFT, TA_RIGHT, TA_CENTER, TA_JUSTIFY from reportlab.lib import colors from uuid import uuid4 from cgi import escape import os def get_me_a_pdf(): title = \"This The Doc Title\" heading = \"First Paragraph\" text = 'bla ' * 10000 styles = getSampleStyleSheet() tmpfilename = os.path.join(request.folder, 'private', str(uuid4())) doc = SimpleDocTemplate(tmpfilename) story = [] story.append(Paragraph(escape(title), styles[\"Title\"])) story.append(Paragraph(escape(heading), styles[\"Heading2\"])) story.append(Paragraph(escape(text), styles[\"Normal\"])) story.append(Spacer(1, 2 * inch)) doc.build(story) data = open(tmpfilename, \"rb\").read() os.unlink(tmpfilename) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return data Does this library have any framework integration? Yes, if you use web2py, you can make simple HTML reports that can be viewed in a browser, or downloaded as PDF. Also, using web2py DAL, you can easily set up a templating engine for PDF documents. Look at [Web2Py] (Web2Py.md) for examples. # TODO fix link What is the development status of this library? This library was improved over the years since the initial port from PHP. Some code is in early development stages (mainly UTF-8 support and some advanced features). The good news is that PHP versions and examples are available from a long time ago, so migration and some bug-fixes are easy. Said that, a former version is working successfully and is commercially supported since late 2008 for electronic invoice templates compliant with AFIP (Argentina IRS) normative, in several environments (Linux, Windows, etc.). It was originally included in PyRece , with thousands downloads to date. For further information see: http://www.pyafipws.com.ar/ http://code.google.com/p/pyafipws/ http://groups.google.com/group/pyafipws In contrast, write_html support is not complete, so it must be considered in alpha state. Further enhancements using web2py helpers and an XML parser will enable parsing more complex HTML files. What is the license of this library (pyfpdf)? LGPL v3.0. Original FPDF uses a permissive license: http://www.fpdf.org/en/FAQ.php#q1 \"FPDF is released under a permissive license: there is no usage restriction.

This elements can act as placeholders, so the program can change the default text \"filling\" the document. Also, the elements can be defined in a CSV file or in a database, so the user can easily adapt the form to his printing needs. A template is used like a dict, setting its items' values. Details - Template definition A template is composed of a header and a list of elements. The header contains the page format, title of the document and other metadata. Elements have the following properties (columns in a CSV, fields in a database): name: placeholder identification type: 'T': texts, 'L': lines, 'I': images, 'B': boxes, 'BC': barcodes x1, y1, x2, y2: top-left, bottom-right coordinates (in mm) font: e.g. \"Arial\" size: text size in points, e.g. 10 bold, italic, underline: text style (non-empty to enable) foreground, background: text and fill colors, e.g. 0xFFFFFF align: text alignment, 'L': left, 'R': right, 'C': center text: default string, can be replaced at runtime priority: Z-order multiline: None for single line (default), True to for multicells (multiple lines), False trims to exactly fit the space defined How to create a template A template can be created in 3 ways: By defining everything manually in a hardcoded way By using a template definition in a CSV document and parsing the CSV with Template.parse_dict() By defining the template in a database (this applies to [Web2Py] (Web2Py.md) integration) Note the following, the definition of a template will contain the elements. The header will be given during instantiation (except for the database method). Example - Hardcoded from fpdf import Template #this will define the ELEMENTS that will compose the template. elements = [ { 'name': 'company_logo', 'type': 'I', 'x1': 20.0, 'y1': 17.0, 'x2': 78.0, 'y2': 30.0, 'font': None, 'size': 0.0, 'bold': 0, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': 'logo', 'priority': 2, }, { 'name': 'company_name', 'type': 'T', 'x1': 17.0, 'y1': 32.5, 'x2': 115.0, 'y2': 37.5, 'font': 'Arial', 'size': 12.0, 'bold': 1, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': '', 'priority': 2, }, { 'name': 'box', 'type': 'B', 'x1': 15.0, 'y1': 15.0, 'x2': 185.0, 'y2': 260.0, 'font': 'Arial', 'size': 0.0, 'bold': 0, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': None, 'priority': 0, }, { 'name': 'box_x', 'type': 'B', 'x1': 95.0, 'y1': 15.0, 'x2': 105.0, 'y2': 25.0, 'font': 'Arial', 'size': 0.0, 'bold': 1, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': None, 'priority': 2, }, { 'name': 'line1', 'type': 'L', 'x1': 100.0, 'y1': 25.0, 'x2': 100.0, 'y2': 57.0, 'font': 'Arial', 'size': 0, 'bold': 0, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': None, 'priority': 3, }, { 'name': 'barcode', 'type': 'BC', 'x1': 20.0, 'y1': 246.5, 'x2': 140.0, 'y2': 254.0, 'font': 'Interleaved 2of5 NT', 'size': 0.75, 'bold': 0, 'italic': 0, 'underline': 0, 'foreground': 0, 'background': 0, 'align': 'I', 'text': '200000000001000159053338016581200810081', 'priority': 3, }, ] #here we instantiate the template and define the HEADER f = Template(format=\"A4\", elements=elements, title=\"Sample Invoice\") f.add_page() #we FILL some of the fields of the template with the information we want #note we access the elements treating the template instance as a \"dict\" f[\"company_name\"] = \"Sample Company\" f[\"company_logo\"] = \"pyfpdf/tutorial/logo.png\" #and now we render the page f.render(\"./template.pdf\") See template.py or [Web2Py] (Web2Py.md) for a complete example. Example - Elements defined in CSV file You define your elements in a CSV file \"mycsvfile.csv\" that will look like: line0;T;20.0;13.0;190.0;13.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 line1;T;20.0;67.0;190.0;67.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 name0;T;21;14;104;25;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 title0;T;64;26;104;30;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 Remember that each line represents an element and each field represents one of the properties of the element in the following order: ('name','type','x1','y1','x2','y2','font','size','bold','italic','underline','foreground','background','align','text','priority', 'multiline') Then you can use the file like this: def test_template(): f = Template(format=\"A4\", title=\"Sample Invoice\") f.parse_csv(\"mycsvfile.csv\") f.add_page() f[\"company_name\"] = \"Sample Company\" response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return f.render(\"./template.pdf\", dest='S') Designer - GUI tool to design templates This library includes a program designer.py to visually modify the designs of a template (e.g., an invoice, report, etc.). Input files are CSV spreadsheets describing the design (see above). Once opened, the designer displays the template with the elements as how they will be located. The toolbar has buttons for: Open, save and print (preview) template Add, delete and duplicate Find items by name or by text Find and replace (modify selected elements, mainly move x/y) Over an element, double left click opens a dialog to edit its text and right click opens a dialog with the properties window. You can select multiple items by holding down shift and left clicking them. To move the elements you can use the arrow keys or drag the elements. To run it, just go to the directory and run: python designer.py (you need to have wx installed). If you are having problems making it work, change the imports on designer.py file to the following (it should be fixed in the next version): import os, sys import wx import wx.lib import wx.lib.ogl as ogl try: from wx.lib.wordwrap import wordwrap except ImportError: wordwrap = lambda text, width, dc: text try: from template import Template except ImportError: # we are frozen? from fpdf.template import Template As an example, the following screenshot shows the Visual Designer, with the sample invoice.csv file open and 'logo' element selected, editing its properties:","title":"Templates"},{"location":"Templates.html#introduction","text":"Templates are predefined documents (like invoices, tax forms, etc.), where each element (text, lines, barcodes, etc.) has a fixed position (x1, y1, x2, y2), style (font, size, etc.) and a default text.

El constructor FPDF es usado aqui con los valores predeterminados: p\u00e1ginas en A4 portrait -vertical- y la unidad de medida en milimetros. Podr\u00eda haberlos especificado explicitamente: pdf=FPDF('P', 'mm', 'A4') Es posible usar landscape -apaisado- (L), otros formatos de p\u00e1gina (como Letter -carta- y Legal -oficio-) y \u00fanidad de medida (pt, cm, in). Por el momento no hay una p\u00e1gina, entonces tenemos que agregar una con add_page . El origen es la esquina superior-izquierda y la posici\u00f3n actual est\u00e1 ubicada a 1 cm de los bordes; los margenes pueden ser cambiados con set_margins . Antes de que pod\u00e1mos imprimir texto, es obligatorio seleccionar una fuente con set_font , de lo contrario el documento ser\u00e1 inv\u00e1lido. Elegimos Arial bold 16: pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16) Podr\u00edamos haber especificado italic -cursiva- con I, underline -subrayado- con U o fuente regular con string vacio (o cualquier combinaci\u00f3n). Noar que el tama\u00f1o de la fuente es dado en puntos, no milimetros (u otra unidad de medida del usuario); esta es la \u00fanica excepci\u00f3n. Las otras fuentes est\u00e1ndar son Times, Courier, Symbol y ZapfDingbats. Podemos ahora imprimir una celda con cell . Una celda es un \u00e1rea rectangular, posiblemente enmarcada, que contiene alg\u00fan texto. Se imprime en la posici\u00f3n actual. Especificamos sus dimensiones, su texto (centrado o alineado), si los bordes deber\u00edan ser dibujados, y donde la posici\u00f3n actual se mueve despu\u00e9s (a la derecha, abajo o al principio de la pr\u00f3xima linea). Para agregar un marco, haremos: pdf.cell(40, 10, 'Hola mundo !', 1) Para agregar una nueva celda pr\u00f3xima a ella con texto centrada y luego ir a la siguiente l\u00ednea, har\u00edamos: pdf.cell(60, 10, 'Hecho con FPDF.', 0, 1, 'C') Nota : el salto de l\u00ednea puede hacerse tambi\u00e9n con ln . Este m\u00e9todo permite especificar adicionalmente la altura del salto. Finalmente, el documento es cerrado y enviado al explorador con output . Podemos haberlo grabado a un fichero al pasarle el nombre de archivo. Precauci\u00f3n : en caso cuando el PDF es enviado al explorador, nada m\u00e1s debe ser envi\u00e1do a la salida, ni antes ni despu\u00e9s (el m\u00ednimo caracter importa). Encabezado, pie de p\u00e1gina, salto de p\u00e1gina e im\u00e1gen Aqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo de dos p\u00e1ginas con encabezado, pie y logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF(FPDF): def header(self): # Logo self.image('logo_pb.png', 10, 8, 33) # Arial bold 15 self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) # Move to the right self.cell(80) # Title self.cell(30, 10, 'Title', 1, 0, 'C') # Line break self.ln(20) # Page footer def footer(self): # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom self.set_y(-15) # Arial italic 8 self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) # Page number self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()) + '/{nb}', 0, 0, 'C') # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF() pdf.alias_nb_pages() pdf.add_page() pdf.set_font('Times', '', 12) for i in range(1, 41): pdf.cell(0, 10, 'Printing line number ' + str(i), 0, 1) pdf.output('tuto2.pdf', 'F') Demo Este ejemplo hace uso de m\u00e9todos header y footer para procesar el encabezado y pie. Son llamados autom\u00e1ticamente. Ya existen en la clase FPDF pero no hacen nada, por lo tanto tenemos que extender la clase y sobreescribirlos. El log es impreso con el m\u00e9todo image especificando su esquina superior izquierda y su ancho. La altura es calculada autom\u00e1ticamente para respetar las proporciones de la im\u00e1gen. Para imprimir el n\u00famero de p\u00e1gina, un valor nulo es pasado como ancho de celda. Significa que la celda deber\u00e1 ser extendida hasta el margen derecho de la p\u00e1gina; es \u00fatil centrar texto. El n\u00famero de p\u00e1gina actual es devuelto por el m\u00e9todo page_no ; y para el n\u00famero total de p\u00e1ginas, ser\u00e1 obtenido mediante el valor especial {nb} que ser\u00e1 sustituido al cerrar el documento (si de antemano se llam\u00f3 alias_nb_pages ). Notar el uso del m\u00e9todo set_y que permite establecer la posici\u00f3n en una ubicaci\u00f3n absoluta en la p\u00e1gina, empezando desde arriba hacia abajo. Otra caracter\u00edstica interesante es usada aqu\u00ed: el salto de p\u00e1gina autom\u00e1tico. Tan pronto una celda cruza el l\u00edmite de una p\u00e1gina (por defecto a 2 centimetros desde abajo), un salto es realizado y la fuente es restaurada. Aunque el encabezado y pie de p\u00e1gina tienen su propia fuente (Arial), el cuerpo continua en Times. Este mecanismo de restauraci\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica tambien se aplica a los colores y el ancho de la l\u00ednea. El l\u00edmite que dispara los saltos de p\u00e1gina puede establecerce con set_auto_page_break . Saltos de l\u00ednea y colores Continuemos con un ejemplo que imprime parrafos justificados. Tambi\u00e9n ilustra el uso de colores. from fpdf import FPDF title = '20000 Leagues Under the Seas' class PDF(FPDF): def header(self): # Arial bold 15 self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) # Calcular ancho del texto (title) y establecer posici\u00f3n w = self.get_string_width(title) + 6 self.set_x((210 - w) / 2) # Colores del marco, fondo y texto self.set_draw_color(0, 80, 180) self.set_fill_color(230, 230, 0) self.set_text_color(220, 50, 50) # Grosor del marco (1 mm) self.set_line_width(1) # Titulo self.cell(w, 9, title, 1, 1, 'C', 1) # Salto de l\u00ednea self.ln(10) def footer(self): # Posici\u00f3n a 1.5 cm desde abajo self.set_y(-15) # Arial italic 8 self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) # Color de texto en gris self.set_text_color(128) # Numero de pagina self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()), 0, 0, 'C') def chapter_title(self, num, label): # Arial 12 self.set_font('Arial', '', 12) # Color de fondo self.set_fill_color(200, 220, 255) # Titulo self.cell(0, 6, 'Chapter %d : %s' % (num, label), 0, 1, 'L', 1) # Salto de l\u00ednea self.ln(4) def chapter_body(self, name): # Leer archivo de texto with open(name, 'rb') as fh: txt = fh.read().decode('latin-1') # Times 12 self.set_font('Times', '', 12) # Emitir texto justificado self.multi_cell(0, 5, txt) # Salto de l\u00ednea self.ln() # Menci\u00f3n en italic -cursiva- self.set_font('', 'I') self.cell(0, 5, '(end of excerpt)') def print_chapter(self, num, title, name): self.add_page() self.chapter_title(num, title) self.chapter_body(name) pdf = PDF() pdf.set_title(title) pdf.set_author('Jules Verne') pdf.print_chapter(1, 'A RUNAWAY REEF', '20k_c1.txt') pdf.print_chapter(2, 'THE PROS AND CONS', '20k_c2.txt') pdf.output('tuto3.pdf', 'F') Demo El m\u00e9todo get_string_width permite determinar la longitud de una cadena en la fuente actual, usado aqu\u00ed para calcular la posici\u00f3n y el ancho del marco que rodea al t\u00edtulo. Los colores son establecidos (v\u00eda set_draw_color , set_fill_color y set_text_color ) y el grosor de la l\u00ednea es establecido a 1 mm (contra 0.2 por defecto) con set_line_width . Finalmente, emitimos la celda (el \u00faltimo par\u00e1metro es True para indicar que el fondo debe ser rellenado). El m\u00e9todo usado para imprimir parrafos es multi_cell . Cada vez que una l\u00ednea alcanza el extremo derecho de la celda o un caracter de retorno de linea, un salto de l\u00ednea es emitido y una nueva celda es autom\u00e1ticamente creada bajo la actual. El texto es justificado por defecto. Dos propiedades del documento son definidas: el t\u00edtulo ( set_title ) y el autor ( set_author ). Las propiedades pueden ser vistas de dos formas. La primera es abrir el documento directamente con Acrobat Reader, ir al men\u00fa Archivo y elegir la opci\u00f3n Propiedades del Documento. La segunda, tambi\u00e9n disponible en el plug-in, es hacer click izquierdo y seleccionar Propiedades del documento (Document Properties).

Elegimos Arial bold 16: pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16) Podr\u00edamos haber especificado italic -cursiva- con I, underline -subrayado- con U o fuente regular con string vacio (o cualquier combinaci\u00f3n). Noar que el tama\u00f1o de la fuente es dado en puntos, no milimetros (u otra unidad de medida del usuario); esta es la \u00fanica excepci\u00f3n. Las otras fuentes est\u00e1ndar son Times, Courier, Symbol y ZapfDingbats. Podemos ahora imprimir una celda con cell . Una celda es un \u00e1rea rectangular, posiblemente enmarcada, que contiene alg\u00fan texto. Se imprime en la posici\u00f3n actual. Especificamos sus dimensiones, su texto (centrado o alineado), si los bordes deber\u00edan ser dibujados, y donde la posici\u00f3n actual se mueve despu\u00e9s (a la derecha, abajo o al principio de la pr\u00f3xima linea). Para agregar un marco, haremos: pdf.cell(40, 10, 'Hola mundo !', 1) Para agregar una nueva celda pr\u00f3xima a ella con texto centrada y luego ir a la siguiente l\u00ednea, har\u00edamos: pdf.cell(60, 10, 'Hecho con FPDF.', 0, 1, 'C') Nota : el salto de l\u00ednea puede hacerse tambi\u00e9n con ln . Este m\u00e9todo permite especificar adicionalmente la altura del salto. Finalmente, el documento es cerrado y enviado al explorador con output . Podemos haberlo grabado a un fichero al pasarle el nombre de archivo. Precauci\u00f3n : en caso cuando el PDF es enviado al explorador, nada m\u00e1s debe ser envi\u00e1do a la salida, ni antes ni despu\u00e9s (el m\u00ednimo caracter importa).","title":"Ejemplo M\u00ednimo"},{"location":"Tutorial-es.html#encabezado-pie-de-pagina-salto-de-pagina-e-imagen","text":"Aqu\u00ed hay un ejemplo de dos p\u00e1ginas con encabezado, pie y logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF(FPDF): def header(self): # Logo self.image('logo_pb.png', 10, 8, 33) # Arial bold 15 self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) # Move to the right self.cell(80) # Title self.cell(30, 10, 'Title', 1, 0, 'C') # Line break self.ln(20) # Page footer def footer(self): # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom self.set_y(-15) # Arial italic 8 self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) # Page number self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()) + '/{nb}', 0, 0, 'C') # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF() pdf.alias_nb_pages() pdf.add_page() pdf.set_font('Times', '', 12) for i in range(1, 41): pdf.cell(0, 10, 'Printing line number ' + str(i), 0, 1) pdf.output('tuto2.pdf', 'F') Demo Este ejemplo hace uso de m\u00e9todos header y footer para procesar el encabezado y pie.

The FPDF constructor is used here with the default values: pages are in A4 portrait and the measure unit is millimeter. It could have been specified explicitly with: pdf = FPDF('P', 'mm', 'A4') It is possible to use landscape ( L ), other page formats (such as Letter and Legal ) and measure units ( pt , cm , in ). There is no page for the moment, so we have to add one with add_page . The origin is at the upper-left corner and the current position is by default placed at 1 cm from the borders; the margins can be changed with set_margins . Before we can print text, it is mandatory to select a font with set_font , otherwise the document would be invalid. We choose Arial bold 16: pdf.set_font('Arial', 'B', 16) We could have specified italics with I , underlined with U or a regular font with an empty string (or any combination). Note that the font size is given in points, not millimeters (or another user unit); it is the only exception. The other standard fonts are Times , Courier , Symbol and ZapfDingbats . We can now print a cell with cell . A cell is a rectangular area, possibly framed, which contains some text. It is output at the current position. We specify its dimensions, its text (centered or aligned), if borders should be drawn, and where the current position moves after it (to the right, below or to the beginning of the next line). To add a frame, we would do this: pdf.cell(40, 10, 'Hello World!', 1) To add a new cell next to it with centered text and go to the next line, we would do: pdf.cell(60, 10, 'Powered by FPDF.', 0, 1, 'C') Remark : the line break can also be done with ln . This method allows to specify in addition the height of the break. Finally, the document is closed and sent to the browser with output . We could have saved it in a file by passing the desired file name. Caution : in case when the PDF is sent to the browser, nothing else must be output, not before nor after (the least space or carriage return matters). If you send some data before, you will get the error message: \"Some data has already been output to browser, can't send PDF file\". If you send after, your browser may display a blank page. Header, footer, page break and image Here is a two page example with header, footer and logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF(FPDF): def header(self): # Logo self.image('logo_pb.png', 10, 8, 33) # Arial bold 15 self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) # Move to the right self.cell(80) # Title self.cell(30, 10, 'Title', 1, 0, 'C') # Line break self.ln(20) # Page footer def footer(self): # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom self.set_y(-15) # Arial italic 8 self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) # Page number self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()) + '/{nb}', 0, 0, 'C') # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF() pdf.alias_nb_pages() pdf.add_page() pdf.set_font('Times', '', 12) for i in range(1, 41): pdf.cell(0, 10, 'Printing line number ' + str(i), 0, 1) pdf.output('tuto2.pdf', 'F') Demo This example makes use of the header and footer methods to process page headers and footers. They are called automatically. They already exist in the FPDF class but do nothing, therefore we have to extend the class and override them. The logo is printed with the image method by specifying its upper-left corner and its width. The height is calculated automatically to respect the image proportions. To print the page number, a null value is passed as the cell width. It means that the cell should extend up to the right margin of the page; it is handy to center text. The current page number is returned by the page_no method; as for the total number of pages, it is obtained by means of the special value {nb} which will be substituted on document closure (provided you first called alias_nb_pages ). Note the use of the set_y method which allows to set position at an absolute location in the page, starting from the top or the bottom. Another interesting feature is used here: the automatic page breaking. As soon as a cell would cross a limit in the page (at 2 centimeters from the bottom by default), a break is performed and the font restored. Although the header and footer select their own font ( Arial ), the body continues with Times . This mechanism of automatic restoration also applies to colors and line width. The limit which triggers page breaks can be set with set_auto_page_break . Line breaks and colors Let's continue with an example which prints justified paragraphs. It also illustrates the use of colors. from fpdf import FPDF title = '20000 Leagues Under the Seas' class PDF(FPDF): def header(self): # Arial bold 15 self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) # Calculate width of title and position w = self.get_string_width(title) + 6 self.set_x((210 - w) / 2) # Colors of frame, background and text self.set_draw_color(0, 80, 180) self.set_fill_color(230, 230, 0) self.set_text_color(220, 50, 50) # Thickness of frame (1 mm) self.set_line_width(1) # Title self.cell(w, 9, title, 1, 1, 'C', 1) # Line break self.ln(10) def footer(self): # Position at 1.5 cm from bottom self.set_y(-15) # Arial italic 8 self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) # Text color in gray self.set_text_color(128) # Page number self.cell(0, 10, 'Page ' + str(self.page_no()), 0, 0, 'C') def chapter_title(self, num, label): # Arial 12 self.set_font('Arial', '', 12) # Background color self.set_fill_color(200, 220, 255) # Title self.cell(0, 6, 'Chapter %d : %s' % (num, label), 0, 1, 'L', 1) # Line break self.ln(4) def chapter_body(self, name): # Read text file with open(name, 'rb') as fh: txt = fh.read().decode('latin-1') # Times 12 self.set_font('Times', '', 12) # Output justified text self.multi_cell(0, 5, txt) # Line break self.ln() # Mention in italics self.set_font('', 'I') self.cell(0, 5, '(end of excerpt)') def print_chapter(self, num, title, name): self.add_page() self.chapter_title(num, title) self.chapter_body(name) pdf = PDF() pdf.set_title(title) pdf.set_author('Jules Verne') pdf.print_chapter(1, 'A RUNAWAY REEF', '20k_c1.txt') pdf.print_chapter(2, 'THE PROS AND CONS', '20k_c2.txt') pdf.output('tuto3.pdf', 'F') Demo The get_string_width method allows determining the length of a string in the current font, which is used here to calculate the position and the width of the frame surrounding the title. Then colors are set (via set_draw_color , set_fill_color and set_text_color ) and the thickness of the line is set to 1 mm (against 0.2 by default) with set_line_width . Finally, we output the cell (the last parameter to true indicates that the background must be filled). The method used to print the paragraphs is multi_cell . Each time a line reaches the right extremity of the cell or a carriage return character is met, a line break is issued and a new cell automatically created under the current one. Text is justified by default. Two document properties are defined: the title ( set_title ) and the author ( set_author ). Properties can be viewed by two means. First is to open the document directly with Acrobat Reader, go to the File menu and choose the Document Properties option. The second, also available from the plug-in, is to right-click and select Document Properties.

Moreover, it embeds only the necessary parts of the fonts that are used in the document, making the file size much smaller than if the whole fonts were embedded. These features were originally developed for the mPDF project, and ported from Ian Back 's sFPDF LGPL PHP version. Before you can use UTF-8, you have to install at least one Unicode font in the font directory (or system font folder). Some free font packages are available for download (extract them into the font folder): DejaVu family: Sans, Sans Condensed, Serif, Serif Condensed, Sans Mono (Supports more than 200 languages) GNU FreeFont family: FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono Indic (ttf-indic-fonts Debian and Ubuntu package) for Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi (including the variants for Punjabi), Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Tibetan AR PL New Sung (firefly): The Open Source Chinese Font (also supports other east Asian languages) Alee (ttf-alee Arch Linux package): General purpose Hangul Truetype fonts that contain Korean syllable and Latin9 (iso8859-15) characters. Fonts-TLWG (formerly ThaiFonts-Scalable) These fonts are included with this library's installers; see Free Font Pack for FPDF below for more information.

Such metrics are stored using the Python Pickle format ( .pkl extension), by default in the font directory (ensure read and write permission!). Additional information about the caching mechanism is defined in the add_font reference. TTF metric files often weigh about 650K, so keep that in mind if you use many TTF fonts and have disk size or memory limitations. By design, metric files are not imported as they could cause a temporary memory leak if not managed properly (this could be an issue in a webserver environment with many processes or threads, so the current implementation discards metrics when FPDF objects are disposed). In most circumstances, you will not notice any difference about storing metric files vs. generating them in each run on-the-fly (according basic tests, elapsed time is equivalent; YMMV). Like the original PHP implementation, this library should work even if it could not store the metric file, and as no source code file is generated at runtime, it should work in restricted environments. Free Font Pack and Copyright Restrictions For your convenience, this library collected 96 TTF files in an optional \"Free Unicode TrueType Font Pack for FPDF\" , with useful fonts commonly distributed with GNU/Linux operating systems (see above for a complete description). This pack is included in the Windows installers, or can be downloaded separately (for any operating system). You could use any TTF font file as long embedding usage is allowed in the licence. If not, a runtime exception will be raised saying: \"ERROR - Font file filename.ttf cannot be embedded due to copyright restrictions.\"","title":"Unicode"},{"location":"Unicode.html#introduction","text":"Introduction Example Metric Files Free Font Pack and Copyright Restrictions The FPDF class was modified adding UTF-8 support. Moreover, it embeds only the necessary parts of the fonts that are used in the document, making the file size much smaller than if the whole fonts were embedded. These features were originally developed for the mPDF project, and ported from Ian Back 's sFPDF LGPL PHP version. Before you can use UTF-8, you have to install at least one Unicode font in the font directory (or system font folder). Some free font packages are available for download (extract them into the font folder): DejaVu family: Sans, Sans Condensed, Serif, Serif Condensed, Sans Mono (Supports more than 200 languages) GNU FreeFont family: FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono Indic (ttf-indic-fonts Debian and Ubuntu package) for Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi (including the variants for Punjabi), Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Tibetan AR PL New Sung (firefly): The Open Source Chinese Font (also supports other east Asian languages) Alee (ttf-alee Arch Linux package): General purpose Hangul Truetype fonts that contain Korean syllable and Latin9 (iso8859-15) characters.

See write_html for more information, supported tags and attributes, etc. Also, using web2py DAL, you can easily set up a templating engine for PDF documents. See Templates for more information. The following examples are packaged in a ready to run application: web2py.app.fpdf.w2p . PyFPDF is included in web2py since release 1.85.2 . Also, you can download the latest version of pyfpdf and uncompress it in the web2py, gluon, contrib folder. Note about images : these sample images are small so they may look like low quality ones. For better results, use bigger images: more DPI (screen is often 72/96DPI, printers are often 300/600DPI). As a rule of thumb, use at least half of the image size when rendering to PDF, ie. if an image is 500x200px, use 250x100px as width and height attributes of the IMG tag. Sample Report You could make a \"professional looking\" bussiness report just using web2py HTML helpers, mixin headers, logos, charts, text and tables. The main advantage of this method is that the same report can be rendered in a HTML view, or can be downloaded as PDF, with a minimal effort: Sample: report.pdf Updated Live Demo (HTML and PDF version): http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/report http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/report.pdf def report(): response.title = \"web2py sample report\" # include a google chart (download it dynamically!) url = \"http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:60,40&chs=500x200&chl=Hello|World&.png\" chart = IMG(_src=url, _width=\"250\", _height=\"100\") # create a small table with some data: rows = [THEAD(TR(TH(\"Key\", _width=\"70%\"), TH(\"Value\", _width=\"30%\"))), TBODY(TR(TD(\"Hello\"), TD(\"60\")), TR(TD(\"World\"), TD(\"40\")))] table = TABLE(*rows, _border=\"0\", _align=\"center\", _width=\"50%\") if request.extension == \"pdf\": from gluon.contrib.pyfpdf import FPDF, HTMLMixin # create a custom class with the required functionality class MyFPDF(FPDF, HTMLMixin): def header(self): \"hook to draw custom page header (logo and title)\" logo = os.path.join(request.env.web2py_path, \"gluon\", \"contrib\", \"pyfpdf\", \"tutorial\", \"logo_pb.png\") self.image(logo, 10, 8, 33) self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) self.cell(65) # padding self.cell(60, 10, response.title, 1, 0, 'C') self.ln(20) def footer(self): \"hook to draw custom page footer (printing page numbers)\" self.set_y(-15) self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) txt = 'Page %s of %s' % (self.page_no(), self.alias_nb_pages()) self.cell(0, 10, txt, 0, 0, 'C') pdf = MyFPDF() # create a page and serialize/render HTML objects pdf.add_page() pdf.write_html(str(XML(table, sanitize=False))) pdf.write_html(str(XML(CENTER(chart), sanitize=False))) # prepare PDF to download: response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return pdf.output(dest='S') else: # normal html view: return dict(chart=chart, table=table) Sample Table Listing Also, you can make nice tables that automatically spreads over several pages, with headers and footers, column and row highlighting, etc., in a very pythonic way: Sample: listing.pdf Updated Live Demo (HTML and PDF version): http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/listing http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/listing.pdf def listing(): response.title = \"web2py sample listing\" # define header and footers: head = THEAD(TR(TH(\"Header 1\", _width=\"50%\"), TH(\"Header 2\", _width=\"30%\"), TH(\"Header 3\", _width=\"20%\"), _bgcolor=\"#A0A0A0\")) foot = TFOOT(TR(TH(\"Footer 1\", _width=\"50%\"), TH(\"Footer 2\", _width=\"30%\"), TH(\"Footer 3\", _width=\"20%\"), _bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\")) # create several rows: rows = [] for i in range(1000): col = i % 2 and \"#F0F0F0\" or \"#FFFFFF\" rows.append(TR(TD(\"Row %s\" %i), TD(\"something\", _align=\"center\"), TD(\"%s\" % i, _align=\"right\"), _bgcolor=col)) # make the table object body = TBODY(*rows) table = TABLE(*[head, foot, body], _border=\"1\", _align=\"center\", _width=\"100%\") if request.extension == \"pdf\": from gluon.contrib.pyfpdf import FPDF, HTMLMixin # define our FPDF class (move to modules if it is reused frequently) class MyFPDF(FPDF, HTMLMixin): def header(self): self.set_font('Arial', 'B', 15) self.cell(0, 10, response.title, 1, 0, 'C') self.ln(20) def footer(self): self.set_y(-15) self.set_font('Arial', 'I', 8) txt = 'Page %s of %s' % (self.page_no(), self.alias_nb_pages()) self.cell(0, 10, txt, 0, 0, 'C') pdf = MyFPDF() # first page: pdf.add_page() pdf.write_html(str(XML(table, sanitize=False))) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return pdf.output(dest='S') else: # normal html view: return dict(table=table)}}} Samples Template Definitions As stated in the Templates page, there are 3 ways of putting your templates in place. As in that page there are samples for the manually hardcoded way and CSV document loading. Here we will only show a sample of the template engine. Sample Templating Engine PyFPDF and web2py can be used to make PDF documents using templates like invoices, badges, certificates, etc.: Sample: invoice.pdf Updated Live Demo: http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/invoice.pdf To handle multiple templates, we can define two tables in web2py: pdf_template: general document information (name, paper size, etc.) pdf_element: several rows for each document, describing graphics primitives and placeholders. In db.py write: db.define_table(\"pdf_template\", Field(\"pdf_template_id\", \"id\"), Field(\"title\"), Field(\"format\", requires=IS_IN_SET([\"A4\", \"legal\", \"letter\"])), ) db.define_table(\"pdf_element\", Field(\"pdf_template_id\", db.pdf_template, requires=IS_IN_DB(db, 'pdf_template.pdf_template_id', 'pdf_template.title')), Field(\"name\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"type\", length=2, requires=IS_IN_SET(['T', 'L', 'I', 'B', 'BC'])), Field(\"x1\", \"double\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"y1\", \"double\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"x2\", \"double\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"y2\", \"double\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"font\", default=\"Arial\", requires=IS_IN_SET(['Courier', 'Arial', 'Times', 'Symbol', 'Zapfdingbats'])), Field(\"size\", \"double\", default=\"10\", requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()), Field(\"bold\", \"boolean\"), Field(\"italic\", \"boolean\"), Field(\"underline\", \"boolean\"), Field(\"foreground\", \"integer\", default=0x000000, comment=\"Color text\"), Field(\"background\", \"integer\", default=0xFFFFFF, comment=\"Fill color\"), Field(\"align\", \"string\", length=1, default=\"L\", requires=IS_IN_SET(['L', 'R', 'C', 'J'])), Field(\"text\", \"text\", comment=\"Default text\"), Field(\"priority\", \"integer\", default=0, comment=\"Z-Order\"), ) Warning : the fields \"type\", \"size\" and \"text\" are reserved words for some DB engines, so validation: db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', pool_size=1, check_reserved=['ALL']) will fail. sqlite, MySQL and postgres work OK. Proposals for new naming ideas are welcome. At this point you could go to web2py AppAdmin and start to define your document templates, or use import/export functions to reuse your already defined formats! Note: if you used designer.py to create the templates, and you want to import the templates with the Web2Py database admin, you will have to modify the file. So, designer.py outputs a file like this: line0;T;20.0;13.0;190.0;13.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 line1;T;20.0;67.0;190.0;67.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 name0;T;21;14;104;25;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 title0;T;64;26;104;30;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 You will have to make it look lke this: pdf_element.pdf_template_id, pdf_element.name, pdf_element.type, pdf_element.x1, pdf_element.y1, pdf_element.x2, pdf_element.y2, pdf_element.font, pdf_element.size, pdf_element.bold, pdf_element.italic, pdf_element.underline, pdf_element.foreground, pdf_element.background, pdf_element.align, pdf_element.text, pdf_element.priority 1,line0,T,20.0,283.0,190.0,283.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,line1,T,20.0,337.0,190.0,337.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,name0,T,21,14,104,25,times,16.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 1,title0,T,64,26,104,30,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 Where the first number indicates the template ID (important for the database system), and the first line indicates the database fields to fill. A simple Python script should do the trick. After defining and filling your database, you can use PyFPDF Templates directly reading row elements from the web2py database: For example, for an invoice, in a controller you could write: def invoice(): from gluon.contrib.pyfpdf import Template import os.path # generate sample invoice (according Argentina's regulations) import random from decimal import Decimal # read elements from db elements = db(db.pdf_element.pdf_template_id == 1).select(orderby=db.pdf_element.priority) f = Template(format=\"A4\", elements = elements, title=\"Sample Invoice\", author=\"Sample Company\", subject=\"Sample Customer\", keywords=\"Electronic TAX Invoice\") # create some random invoice line items and detail data detail = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur. \" * 5 items = [] for i in range(1, 30): ds = \"Sample product %s\" % i qty = random.randint(1, 10) price = round(random.random() * 100, 3) code = \"%s%s%02d\" % (chr(random.randint(65, 90)), chr(random.randint(65, 90)), i) items.append(dict(code=code, unit='u', qty=qty, price=price, amount=qty * price, ds=\"%s: %s\" % (i, ds))) # divide and count lines lines = 0 li_items = [] for it in items: qty = it['qty'] code = it['code'] unit = it['unit'] for ds in f.split_multicell(it['ds'], 'item_description01'): # add item description line (without price nor amount) li_items.append(dict(code=code, ds=ds, qty=qty, unit=unit, price=None, amount=None)) # clean qty and code (show only at first) unit = qty = code = None # set last item line price and amount li_items[-1].update(amount = it['amount'], price = it['price']) # split detail into each line description obs=\"\\n<U>Detail:</U>\\n\\n\" + detail for ds in f.split_multicell(obs, 'item_description01'): li_items.append(dict(code=code, ds=ds, qty=qty, unit=unit, price=None, amount=None)) # calculate pages: lines = len(li_items) max_lines_per_page = 24 pages = lines / (max_lines_per_page - 1) if lines % (max_lines_per_page - 1): pages = pages + 1 # fill placeholders for each page for page in range(1, pages + 1): f.add_page() f['page'] = 'Page %s of %s' % (page, pages) if pages > 1 and page < pages: s = 'Continues on page %s' % (page + 1) else: s = '' f['item_description%02d' % (max_lines_per_page + 1)] = s f[\"company_name\"] = \"Sample Company\" f[\"company_logo\"] = os.path.join(request.env.web2py_path, \"gluon\", \"contrib\", \"pyfpdf\", \"tutorial\", \"logo.png\") f[\"company_header1\"] = \"Some Address - somewhere -\" f[\"company_header2\"] = \"http://www.example.com\" f[\"company_footer1\"] = \"Tax Code ...\" f[\"company_footer2\"] = \"Tax/VAT ID ...\" f['number'] = '0001-00001234' f['issue_date'] = '2010-09-10' f['due_date'] = '2099-09-10' f['customer_name'] = \"Sample Client\" f['customer_address'] = \"Siempreviva 1234\" # print line item... li = 0 k = 0 total = Decimal(\"0.00\") for it in li_items: k = k + 1 if k > page * (max_lines_per_page - 1): break if it['amount']: total += Decimal(\"%.6f\" % it['amount']) if k > (page - 1) * (max_lines_per_page - 1): li += 1 if it['qty'] is not None: f['item_quantity%02d' % li] = it['qty'] if it['code'] is not None: f['item_code%02d' % li] = it['code'] if it['unit'] is not None: f['item_unit%02d' % li] = it['unit'] f['item_description%02d' % li] = it['ds'] if it['price'] is not None: f['item_price%02d' % li] = \"%0.3f\" % it['price'] if it['amount'] is not None: f['item_amount%02d' % li] = \"%0.2f\" % it['amount'] # last page? print totals: if pages == page: f['net'] = \"%0.2f\" % (total / Decimal(\"1.21\")) f['vat'] = \"%0.2f\" % (total * (1 - 1 / Decimal(\"1.21\"))) f['total_label'] = 'Total:' else: f['total_label'] = 'SubTotal:' f['total'] = \"%0.2f\" % total response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' return f.render('invoice.pdf', dest='S') Of course, this is a hardcoded example.

Proposals for new naming ideas are welcome. At this point you could go to web2py AppAdmin and start to define your document templates, or use import/export functions to reuse your already defined formats! Note: if you used designer.py to create the templates, and you want to import the templates with the Web2Py database admin, you will have to modify the file. So, designer.py outputs a file like this: line0;T;20.0;13.0;190.0;13.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 line1;T;20.0;67.0;190.0;67.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 name0;T;21;14;104;25;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 title0;T;64;26;104;30;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 You will have to make it look lke this: pdf_element.pdf_template_id, pdf_element.name, pdf_element.type, pdf_element.x1, pdf_element.y1, pdf_element.x2, pdf_element.y2, pdf_element.font, pdf_element.size, pdf_element.bold, pdf_element.italic, pdf_element.underline, pdf_element.foreground, pdf_element.background, pdf_element.align, pdf_element.text, pdf_element.priority 1,line0,T,20.0,283.0,190.0,283.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,line1,T,20.0,337.0,190.0,337.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,name0,T,21,14,104,25,times,16.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 1,title0,T,64,26,104,30,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 Where the first number indicates the template ID (important for the database system), and the first line indicates the database fields to fill.
