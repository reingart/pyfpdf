pyfpdf: FPDF for Python
=======================

PyFPDF is a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP
(see [FPDF][1]: "Free"-PDF, a well-known PDFlib-extension replacement with many
examples, scripts and derivatives).

Compared with other PDF libraries, PyFPDF is simple, small and versatile, with
advanced capabilities, and is easy to learn, extend and maintain.
