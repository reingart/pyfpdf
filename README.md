pyfpdf: FPDF for python
=======================

PyFPDF is a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP (see [FPDF][1] "Free"-PDF, a well-known 
PDFlib-extension replacement with many examples, scripts and derivatives).

Compared with other PDF libraries, PyFPDF is simple, small and versatile, with advanced capabilities and easy to learn, 
extend and maintain.
